| 1   | [Litware, Inc. is a medium-sized finance company. Litware has a main office in Boston. The network contains an Active Directory forest named Litware.com that is linked to an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant named Litware.com. All users have Azure Active Directory Premium P2 licenses. Litware has a second Azure AD tenant named dev.Litware.com that is used as a development environment. The Litware.com tenant has a conditional acess policy named capolicy1. Capolicy1 requires that when users manage the Azure subscription for a production environment by using the Azure portal, they must connect from a hybrid Azure AD-joined device. Litware has 10 Azure subscriptions that are linked to the Litware.com tenant and five Azure subscriptions that are linked to the dev.Litware.com tenant. All the subscriptions are in an Enterprise Agreement (EA). The Litware.com tenant contains a custom Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) role named Role1 that grants the DataActions read permission to the blobs and files in Azure Storage. The on-premises network of Litware contains the resources shown in the following table. Litware has ExpressRoute connectivity to Azure. Litware plans to implement the following changes: Migrate DB1 and DB2 to Azure. Migrate App1 to Azure virtual machines. Deploy the Azure virtual machines that will host App1 to Azure dedicated hosts. Litware identifies the following authentication and authorization requirements: Users that manage the production environment by using the Azure portal must connect from a hybrid Azure AD-joined device and authenticate by using Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). The Network Contributor built-in RBAC role must be used to grant permission to all the virtual networks in all the Azure subscriptions. To access the resources in Azure, App1 must use the managed identity of the virtual machines that will host the app. Role1 must be used to assign permissions to the storage accounts of all the Azure subscriptions. RBAC roles must be applied at the highest level possible. Litware identifies the following resiliency requirements: Once migrated to Azure, DB1 and DB2 must meet the following requirements: Maintain availability if two availability zones in the local Azure region fail. Fail over automatically. Minimize I/O latency. App1 must meet the following requirements: Be hosted in an Azure region that supports availability zones. Be hosted on Azure virtual machines that support automatic scaling. Maintain availability if two availability zones in the local Azure region fail. Litware identifies the following security and compliance requirements: Once App1 is migrated to Azure, you must ensure that new data can be written to the app, and the modification of new and existing data is prevented for a period of three years. On-premises users and services must be able to access the Azure Storage account that will host the data in App1. Access to the public endpoint of the Azure Storage account that will host the App1 data must be prevented. All Azure SQL databases in the production environment must have Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) enabled. App1 must not share physical hardware with other workloads. Litware identifies the following business requirements: Minimize administrative effort. Minimize costs. You plan to migrate App1 to Azure. You need to recommend a storage solution for App1 that meets the security and compliance requirements. Which type of storage should you recommend, and how should you recommend configuring the storage?](#litware-inc-is-a-medium-sized-finance-company-litware-has-a-main-office-in-boston-the-network-contains-an-active-directory-forest-named-litwarecom-that-is-linked-to-an-azure-active-directory-azure-ad-tenant-named-litwarecom-all-users-have-azure-active-directory-premium-p2-licenses-litware-has-a-second-azure-ad-tenant-named-devlitwarecom-that-is-used-as-a-development-environment-the-litwarecom-tenant-has-a-conditional-acess-policy-named-capolicy1-capolicy1-requires-that-when-users-manage-the-azure-subscription-for-a-production-environment-by-using-the-azure-portal-they-must-connect-from-a-hybrid-azure-ad-joined-device-litware-has-10-azure-subscriptions-that-are-linked-to-the-litwarecom-tenant-and-five-azure-subscriptions-that-are-linked-to-the-devlitwarecom-tenant-all-the-subscriptions-are-in-an-enterprise-agreement-ea-the-litwarecom-tenant-contains-a-custom-azure-role-based-access-control-azure-rbac-role-named-role1-that-grants-the-dataactions-read-permission-to-the-blobs-and-files-in-azure-storage-the-on-premises-network-of-litware-contains-the-resources-shown-in-the-following-table-litware-has-expressroute-connectivity-to-azure-litware-plans-to-implement-the-following-changes-migrate-db1-and-db2-to-azure-migrate-app1-to-azure-virtual-machines-deploy-the-azure-virtual-machines-that-will-host-app1-to-azure-dedicated-hosts-litware-identifies-the-following-authentication-and-authorization-requirements-users-that-manage-the-production-environment-by-using-the-azure-portal-must-connect-from-a-hybrid-azure-ad-joined-device-and-authenticate-by-using-azure-multi-factor-authentication-mfa-the-network-contributor-built-in-rbac-role-must-be-used-to-grant-permission-to-all-the-virtual-networks-in-all-the-azure-subscriptions-to-access-the-resources-in-azure-app1-must-use-the-managed-identity-of-the-virtual-machines-that-will-host-the-app-role1-must-be-used-to-assign-permissions-to-the-storage-accounts-of-all-the-azure-subscriptions-rbac-roles-must-be-applied-at-the-highest-level-possible-litware-identifies-the-following-resiliency-requirements-once-migrated-to-azure-db1-and-db2-must-meet-the-following-requirements-maintain-availability-if-two-availability-zones-in-the-local-azure-region-fail-fail-over-automatically-minimize-io-latency-app1-must-meet-the-following-requirements-be-hosted-in-an-azure-region-that-supports-availability-zones-be-hosted-on-azure-virtual-machines-that-support-automatic-scaling-maintain-availability-if-two-availability-zones-in-the-local-azure-region-fail-litware-identifies-the-following-security-and-compliance-requirements-once-app1-is-migrated-to-azure-you-must-ensure-that-new-data-can-be-written-to-the-app-and-the-modification-of-new-and-existing-data-is-prevented-for-a-period-of-three-years-on-premises-users-and-services-must-be-able-to-access-the-azure-storage-account-that-will-host-the-data-in-app1-access-to-the-public-endpoint-of-the-azure-storage-account-that-will-host-the-app1-data-must-be-prevented-all-azure-sql-databases-in-the-production-environment-must-have-transparent-data-encryption-tde-enabled-app1-must-not-share-physical-hardware-with-other-workloads-litware-identifies-the-following-business-requirements-minimize-administrative-effort-minimize-costs-you-plan-to-migrate-app1-to-azure-you-need-to-recommend-a-storage-solution-for-app1-that-meets-the-security-and-compliance-requirements-which-type-of-storage-should-you-recommend-and-how-should-you-recommend-configuring-the-storage)

| 3   | [The on-premises network contains a single Active Directory domain named contoso.com. Contoso has a single Azure subscription. Contoso has a business partnership with Fabrikam, Inc. Fabrikam users access some Contoso applications over the internet by using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) guest accounts. Contoso plans to deploy two applications named App1 and App2 to Azure. App1 will be a Python web app hosted in Azure App Service that requires a Linux runtime. Users from Contoso and Fabrikam will access App1. App1 will access several services that require third-party credentials and access strings. The credentials and access strings are stored in Azure Key Vault. App1 will have six instances: three in the East US Azure region and three in the West Europe Azure region. App1 has the following data requirements: Each instance will write data to a data store in the same availability zone as the instance. Data written by any App1 instance must be visible to all App1 instances. App1 will only be accessible from the internet. App1 has the following connection requirements: Connections to App1 must pass through a web application firewall (WAF). Connections to App1 must be active-active load balanced between instances. All connections to App1 from North America must be directed to the East US region. All other connections must be directed to the West Europe region. Every hour, you will run a maintenance task by invoking a PowerShell script that copies files from all the App1 instances. The PowerShell script will run from a central location. App2 will be a NET app hosted in App Service that requires a Windows runtime. App2 has the following file storage requirements: Save files to an Azure Storage account. Replicate files to an on-premises location. Ensure that on-premises clients can read the files over the LAN by using the SMB protocol. You need to monitor App2 to analyze how long it takes to perform different transactions within the application. The solution must not require changes to the application code. Application developers will constantly develop new versions of App1 and App2. The development process must meet the following requirements: A staging instance of a new application version must be deployed to the application host before the new version is used in production. After testing the new version, the staging version of the application will replace the production version. The switch to the new application version from staging to production must occur without any downtime of the application. Contoso identifies the following requirements for managing Fabrikam access to resources: Every month, an account manager at Fabrikam must review which Fabrikam users have access permissions to App1. Accounts that no longer need permissions must be removed as guests. The solution must minimize development effort. All secrets used by Azure services must be stored in Azure Key Vault. Services that require credentials must have the credentials tied to the service instance. The credentials must NOT be shared between services.

| 7   | [Fabrikam, Inc. is an engineering company that has offices throughout Europe. The company has a main office in London and three branch offices in Amsterdam, Berlin, and Rome. The network contains two Active Directory forests named corp.fabrikam.com and rd.fabrikam.com. There are no trust relationships between the forests. Corp.fabrikam.com is a production forest that contains identities used for internal user and computer authentication. Rd.fabrikam.com is used by the research and development (R&D) department only. The R&D department is restricted to using on-premises resources only. Each office contains at least one domain controller from the corp.fabrikam.com domain. The main office contains all the domain controllers for the rd.fabrikam.com forest. All the offices have a high-speed connection to the internet. An existing application named WebApp1 is hosted in the data center of the London office. WebApp1 is used by customers to place and track orders. WebApp1 has a web tier that uses Microsoft Internet information Services (IIS) and a database tier that runs Microsoft SQL Server 2016. The web tier and the database tier are deployed to virtual machines that run on Hyper-V. The IT department currently uses a separate Hyper-V environment to test updates to WebApp1. Fabrikam purchases all Microsoft licenses through a Microsoft Enterprise Agreement that includes Software Assurance. The use of WebApp1 is unpredictable. At peak times, users often report delays. At other times, many resources for WebApp1 are underutilized. Fabrikam plans to move most of its production workloads to Azure during the next few years, including virtual machines that rely on Active Directory for authentication. As one of its first projects, the company plans to establish a hybrid identity model, facilitating an upcoming Microsoft 365 deployment. All R&D operations will remain on-premises. Fabrikam plans to migrate the production and test instances of WebApp1 to Azure. Fabrikam identifies the following technical requirements: Website content must be easily updated from a single point. User input must be minimized when provisioning new web app instances. Whenever possible, existing on-premises licenses must be used to reduce cost. Users must always authenticate by using their corp.fabrikam.com UPN identity. Any new deployments to Azure must be redundant in case an Azure region fails. Whenever possible, solutions must be deployed to Azure by using the Standard pricing tier of Azure App Service. An email distribution group named IT Support must be notified of any issues relating to the directory synchronization services. In the event that a link fails between Azure and the on-premises network, ensure that the virtual machines hosted in Azure can authenticate to Active Directory. Directory synchronization between Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and corp.fabrikam.com must not be affected by a link failure between Azure and the on- premises network. Fabrikam identifies the following database requirements: Database metrics for the production instance of WebApp1 must be available for analysis so that database administrators can optimize the performance settings. To avoid disrupting customer access, database downtime must be minimized when databases are migrated. Database backups must be retained for a minimum of seven years to meet compliance requirements. Fabrikam identifies the following security requirements: Company information including policies, templates, and data must be inaccessible to anyone outside the company. Users on the on-premises network must be able to authenticate to corp.fabrikam.com if an internet link fails. Administrators must be able authenticate to the Azure portal by using their corp.fabrikam.com credentials. All administrative access to the Azure portal must be secured by using multi-factor authentication (MFA). The testing of WebApp1 updates must not be visible to anyone outside the company. You need to recommend a solution to meet the database retention requirements.

| 15  | [Fabrikam, Inc. is an engineering company that has offices throughout Europe. The company has a main office in London and three branch offices in Amsterdam, Berlin, and Rome. The network contains two Active Directory forests named corp.fabrikam.com and rd.fabrikam.com. There are no trust relationships between the forests. Corp.fabrikam.com is a production forest that contains identities used for internal user and computer authentication. Rd.fabrikam.com is used by the research and development (R&D) department only. The R&D department is restricted to using on-premises resources only. Each office contains at least one domain controller from the corp.fabrikam.com domain. The main office contains all the domain controllers for the rd.fabrikam.com forest. All the offices have a high-speed connection to the internet. An existing application named WebApp1 is hosted in the data center of the London office. WebApp1 is used by customers to place and track orders. WebApp1 has a web tier that uses Microsoft Internet information Services (IIS) and a database tier that runs Microsoft SQL Server 2016. The web tier and the database tier are deployed to virtual machines that run on Hyper-V. The IT department currently uses a separate Hyper-V environment to test updates to WebApp1. Fabrikam purchases all Microsoft licenses through a Microsoft Enterprise Agreement that includes Software Assurance. The use of WebApp1 is unpredictable. At peak times, users often report delays. At other times, many resources for WebApp1 are underutilized. Fabrikam plans to move most of its production workloads to Azure during the next few years, including virtual machines that rely on Active Directory for authentication. As one of its first projects, the company plans to establish a hybrid identity model, facilitating an upcoming Microsoft 365 deployment. All R&D operations will remain on-premises. Fabrikam plans to migrate the production and test instances of WebApp1 to Azure. Fabrikam identifies the following technical requirements: Website content must be easily updated from a single point. User input must be minimized when provisioning new web app instances. Whenever possible, existing on-premises licenses must be used to reduce cost. Users must always authenticate by using their corp.fabrikam.com UPN identity. Any new deployments to Azure must be redundant in case an Azure region fails. Whenever possible, solutions must be deployed to Azure by using the Standard pricing tier of Azure App Service. An email distribution group named IT Support must be notified of any issues relating to the directory synchronization services. In the event that a link fails between Azure and the on-premises network, ensure that the virtual machines hosted in Azure can authenticate to Active Directory. Directory synchronization between Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and corp.fabrikam.com must not be affected by a link failure between Azure and the on- premises network. Fabrikam identifies the following database requirements: Database metrics for the production instance of WebApp1 must be available for analysis so that database administrators can optimize the performance settings. To avoid disrupting customer access, database downtime must be minimized when databases are migrated. Database backups must be retained for a minimum of seven years to meet compliance requirements. Fabrikam identifies the following security requirements: Company information including policies, templates, and data must be inaccessible to anyone outside the company. Users on the on-premises network must be able to authenticate to corp.fabrikam.com if an internet link fails. Administrators must be able authenticate to the Azure portal by using their corp.fabrikam.com credentials. All administrative access to the Azure portal must be secured by using multi-factor authentication (MFA). The testing of WebApp1 updates must not be visible to anyone outside the company.

The Litware.com tenant has a conditional acess policy named capolicy1. Capolicy1 requires that when users manage the Azure subscription for a production environment by using the Azure portal, they must connect from a hybrid Azure AD-joined device. Litware has 10 Azure subscriptions that are linked to the Litware.com tenant and five Azure subscriptions that are linked to the dev.Litware.com tenant. All the subscriptions are in an Enterprise Agreement (EA). The Litware.com tenant contains a custom Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) role named Role1 that grants the DataActions read permission to the blobs and files in Azure Storage. The on-premises network of Litware contains the resources shown in the following table. Litware has ExpressRoute connectivity to Azure. Litware plans to implement the following changes: Migrate DB1 and DB2 to Azure. Migrate App1 to Azure virtual machines. Deploy the Azure virtual machines that will host App1 to Azure dedicated hosts. Litware identifies the following authentication and authorization requirements: Users that manage the production environment by using the Azure portal must connect from a hybrid Azure AD-joined device and authenticate by using Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). The Network Contributor built-in RBAC role must be used to grant permission to all the virtual networks in all the Azure subscriptions. To access the resources in Azure, App1 must use the managed identity of the virtual machines that will host the app. Role1 must be used to assign permissions to the storage accounts of all the Azure subscriptions. RBAC roles must be applied at the highest level possible. Litware identifies the following resiliency requirements: Once migrated to Azure, DB1 and DB2 must meet the following requirements: Maintain availability if two availability zones in the local Azure region fail. Fail over automatically. Minimize I/O latency. App1 must meet the following requirements: Be hosted in an Azure region that supports availability zones. Be hosted on Azure virtual machines that support automatic scaling. Maintain availability if two availability zones in the local Azure region fail. Litware identifies the following security and compliance requirements: Once App1 is migrated to Azure, you must ensure that new data can be written to the app, and the modification of new and existing data is prevented for a period of three years. On-premises users and services must be able to access the Azure Storage account that will host the data in App1. Access to the public endpoint of the Azure Storage account that will host the App1 data must be prevented.

| 38  | [Fabrikam, Inc. is an engineering company that has offices throughout Europe. The company has a main office in London and three branch offices in Amsterdam, Berlin, and Rome. The network contains two Active Directory forests named corp.fabrikam.com and rd.fabrikam.com. There are no trust relationships between the forests. Corp.fabrikam.com is a production forest that contains identities used for internal user and computer authentication. Rd.fabrikam.com is used by the research and development (R&D) department only. The R&D department is restricted to using on-premises resources only. Each office contains at least one domain controller from the corp.fabrikam.com domain. The main office contains all the domain controllers for the rd.fabrikam.com forest. All the offices have a high-speed connection to the internet. An existing application named WebApp1 is hosted in the data center of the London office. WebApp1 is used by customers to place and track orders. WebApp1 has a web tier that uses Microsoft Internet information Services (IIS) and a database tier that runs Microsoft SQL Server 2016. The web tier and the database tier are deployed to virtual machines that run on Hyper-V. The IT department currently uses a separate Hyper-V environment to test updates to WebApp1. Fabrikam purchases all Microsoft licenses through a Microsoft Enterprise Agreement that includes Software Assurance. The use of WebApp1 is unpredictable. At peak times, users often report delays. At other times, many resources for WebApp1 are underutilized. Fabrikam plans to move most of its production workloads to Azure during the next few years, including virtual machines that rely on Active Directory for authentication. As one of its first projects, the company plans to establish a hybrid identity model, facilitating an upcoming Microsoft 365 deployment. All R&D operations will remain on-premises. Fabrikam plans to migrate the production and test instances of WebApp1 to Azure. Fabrikam identifies the following technical requirements: Website content must be easily updated from a single point.

| 41  | [Litware, Inc. is a medium-sized finance company. Litware has a main office in Boston. The network contains an Active Directory forest named Litware.com that is linked to an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant named Litware.com. All users have Azure Active Directory Premium P2 licenses. Litware has a second Azure AD tenant named dev.Litware.com that is used as a development environment. The Litware.com tenant has a conditional acess policy named capolicy1. Capolicy1 requires that when users manage the Azure subscription for a production environment by using the Azure portal, they must connect from a hybrid Azure AD-joined device. Litware has 10 Azure subscriptions that are linked to the Litware.com tenant and five Azure subscriptions that are linked to the dev.Litware.com tenant. All the subscriptions are in an Enterprise Agreement (EA). The Litware.com tenant contains a custom Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) role named Role1 that grants the DataActions read permission to the blobs and files in Azure Storage. The on-premises network of Litware contains the resources shown in the following table. Litware has ExpressRoute connectivity to Azure. Litware plans to implement the following changes: Migrate DB1 and DB2 to Azure. Migrate App1 to Azure virtual machines. Deploy the Azure virtual machines that will host App1 to Azure dedicated hosts. Litware identifies the following authentication and authorization requirements: Users that manage the production environment by using the Azure portal must connect from a hybrid Azure AD-joined device and authenticate by using Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). The Network Contributor built-in RBAC role must be used to grant permission to all the virtual networks in all the Azure subscriptions. To access the resources in Azure, App1 must use the managed identity of the virtual machines that will host the app. Role1 must be used to assign permissions to the storage accounts of all the Azure subscriptions. RBAC roles must be applied at the highest level possible. Litware identifies the following resiliency requirements: Once migrated to Azure, DB1 and DB2 must meet the following requirements: Maintain availability if two availability zones in the local Azure region fail. Fail over automatically. Minimize I/O latency. App1 must meet the following requirements: Be hosted in an Azure region that supports availability zones. Be hosted on Azure virtual machines that support automatic scaling. Maintain availability if two availability zones in the local Azure region fail. Litware identifies the following security and compliance requirements: Once App1 is migrated to Azure, you must ensure that new data can be written to the app, and the modification of new and existing data is prevented for a period of three years. On-premises users and services must be able to access the Azure Storage account that will host the data in App1. Access to the public endpoint of the Azure Storage account that will host the App1 data must be prevented. All Azure SQL databases in the production environment must have Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) enabled. App1 must not share physical hardware with other workloads. Litware identifies the following business requirements: Minimize administrative effort. Minimize costs.

As one of its first projects, the company plans to establish a hybrid identity model, facilitating an upcoming Microsoft 365 deployment. All R&D operations will remain on-premises. Fabrikam plans to migrate the production and test instances of WebApp1 to Azure. Fabrikam identifies the following technical requirements: Website content must be easily updated from a single point. User input must be minimized when provisioning new web app instances. Whenever possible, existing on-premises licenses must be used to reduce cost. Users must always authenticate by using their corp.fabrikam.com UPN identity. Any new deployments to Azure must be redundant in case an Azure region fails. Whenever possible, solutions must be deployed to Azure by using the Standard pricing tier of Azure App Service. An email distribution group named IT Support must be notified of any issues relating to the directory synchronization services. In the event that a link fails between Azure and the on-premises network, ensure that the virtual machines hosted in Azure can authenticate to Active Directory. Directory synchronization between Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and corp.fabrikam.com must not be affected by a link failure between Azure and the on- premises network. Fabrikam identifies the following database requirements: Database metrics for the production instance of WebApp1 must be available for analysis so that database administrators can optimize the performance settings. To avoid disrupting customer access, database downtime must be minimized when databases are migrated. Database backups must be retained for a minimum of seven years to meet compliance requirements. Fabrikam identifies the following security requirements: Company information including policies, templates, and data must be inaccessible to anyone outside the company. Users on the on-premises network must be able to authenticate to corp.fabrikam.com if an internet link fails. Administrators must be able authenticate to the Azure portal by using their corp.fabrikam.com credentials. All administrative access to the Azure portal must be secured by using multi-factor authentication (MFA). The testing of WebApp1 updates must not be visible to anyone outside the company.

The network contains two Active Directory forests named corp.fabnkam.com and rd.fabrikam.com. There are no trust relationships between the forests. Corp.fabrikam.com is a production forest that contains identities used for internal user and computer authentication. Rd.fabrikam.com is used by the research and development (R&D) department only. The R&D department is restricted to using on-premises resources only. Each office contains at least one domain controller from the corp.fabrikam.com domain. The main office contains all the domain controllers for the rd.fabrikam.com forest. All the offices have a high-speed connection to the Internet. An existing application named WebApp1 is hosted in the data center of the London office. WebApp1 is used by customers to place and track orders. WebApp1 has a web tier that uses Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) and a database tier that runs Microsoft SQL Server 2016. The web tier and the database tier are deployed to virtual machines that run on Hyper-V. The IT department currently uses a separate Hyper-V environment to test updates to WebApp1. Fabrikam purchases all Microsoft licenses through a Microsoft Enterprise Agreement that includes Software Assurance. The use of Web App1 is unpredictable. At peak times, users often report delays.

Fabrikam users access some Contoso applications over the internet by using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) guest accounts. Contoso plans to deploy two applications named App1 and App2 to Azure. App1 will be a Python web app hosted in Azure App Service that requires a Linux runtime. Users from Contoso and Fabrikam will access App1. App1 will access several services that require third-party credentials and access strings. The credentials and access strings are stored in Azure Key Vault. App1 will have six instances: three in the East US Azure region and three in the West Europe Azure region. App1 has the following data requirements: Each instance will write data to a data store in the same availability zone as the instance. Data written by any App1 instance must be visible to all App1 instances. App1 will only be accessible from the internet. App1 has the following connection requirements: Connections to App1 must pass through a web application firewall (WAF). Connections to App1 must be active-active load balanced between instances. All connections to App1 from North America must be directed to the East US region. All other connections must be directed to the West Europe region. Every hour, you will run a maintenance task by invoking a PowerShell script that copies files from all the App1 instances. The PowerShell script will run from a central location. App2 will be a NET app hosted in App Service that requires a Windows runtime. App2 has the following file storage requirements: Save files to an Azure Storage account. Replicate files to an on-premises location. Ensure that on-premises clients can read the files over the LAN by using the SMB protocol. You need to monitor App2 to analyze how long it takes to perform different transactions within the application. The solution must not require changes to the application code. Application developers will constantly develop new versions of App1 and App2. The development process must meet the following requirements: A staging instance of a new application version must be deployed to the application host before the new version is used in production. After testing the new version, the staging version of the application will replace the production version. The switch to the new application version from staging to production must occur without any downtime of the application. Contoso identifies the following requirements for managing Fabrikam access to resources: Every month, an account manager at Fabrikam must review which Fabrikam users have access permissions to App1. Accounts that no longer need permissions must be removed as guests. The solution must minimize development effort. All secrets used by Azure services must be stored in Azure Key Vault.

The network contains an Active Directory forest named Litware.com that is linked to an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant named Litware.com. All users have Azure Active Directory Premium P2 licenses. Litware has a second Azure AD tenant named dev.Litware.com that is used as a development environment. The Litware.com tenant has a conditional acess policy named capolicy1. Capolicy1 requires that when users manage the Azure subscription for a production environment by using the Azure portal, they must connect from a hybrid Azure AD-joined device. Litware has 10 Azure subscriptions that are linked to the Litware.com tenant and five Azure subscriptions that are linked to the dev.Litware.com tenant. All the subscriptions are in an Enterprise Agreement (EA). The Litware.com tenant contains a custom Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) role named Role1 that grants the DataActions read permission to the blobs and files in Azure Storage. The on-premises network of Litware contains the resources shown in the following table. Litware has ExpressRoute connectivity to Azure. Litware plans to implement the following changes: Migrate DB1 and DB2 to Azure. Migrate App1 to Azure virtual machines. Deploy the Azure virtual machines that will host App1 to Azure dedicated hosts. Litware identifies the following authentication and authorization requirements: Users that manage the production environment by using the Azure portal must connect from a hybrid Azure AD-joined device and authenticate by using Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). The Network Contributor built-in RBAC role must be used to grant permission to all the virtual networks in all the Azure subscriptions. To access the resources in Azure, App1 must use the managed identity of the virtual machines that will host the app. Role1 must be used to assign permissions to the storage accounts of all the Azure subscriptions. RBAC roles must be applied at the highest level possible. Litware identifies the following resiliency requirements: Once migrated to Azure, DB1 and DB2 must meet the following requirements: Maintain availability if two availability zones in the local Azure region fail. Fail over automatically. Minimize I/O latency. App1 must meet the following requirements: Be hosted in an Azure region that supports availability zones. Be hosted on Azure virtual machines that support automatic scaling. Maintain availability if two availability zones in the local Azure region fail. Litware identifies the following security and compliance requirements: Once App1 is migrated to Azure, you must ensure that new data can be written to the app, and the modification of new and existing data is prevented for a period of three years. On-premises users and services must be able to access the Azure Storage account that will host the data in App1. Access to the public endpoint of the Azure Storage account that will host the App1 data must be prevented. All Azure SQL databases in the production environment must have Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) enabled. App1 must not share physical hardware with other workloads. Litware identifies the following business requirements: Minimize administrative effort. Minimize costs. You plan to migrate App1 to Azure. You need to recommend a storage solution for App1 that meets the security and compliance requirements.

### The on-premises network contains a single Active Directory domain named contoso.com. Contoso has a single Azure subscription. Contoso has a business partnership with Fabrikam, Inc. Fabrikam users access some Contoso applications over the internet by using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) guest accounts. Contoso plans to deploy two applications named App1 and App2 to Azure. App1 will be a Python web app hosted in Azure App Service that requires a Linux runtime. Users from Contoso and Fabrikam will access App1. App1 will access several services that require third-party credentials and access strings. The credentials and access strings are stored in Azure Key Vault. App1 will have six instances: three in the East US Azure region and three in the West Europe Azure region. App1 has the following data requirements: Each instance will write data to a data store in the same availability zone as the instance. Data written by any App1 instance must be visible to all App1 instances. App1 will only be accessible from the internet. App1 has the following connection requirements: Connections to App1 must pass through a web application firewall (WAF). Connections to App1 must be active-active load balanced between instances. All connections to App1 from North America must be directed to the East US region. All other connections must be directed to the West Europe region. Every hour, you will run a maintenance task by invoking a PowerShell script that copies files from all the App1 instances. The PowerShell script will run from a central location. App2 will be a NET app hosted in App Service that requires a Windows runtime. App2 has the following file storage requirements: Save files to an Azure Storage account. Replicate files to an on-premises location. Ensure that on-premises clients can read the files over the LAN by using the SMB protocol. You need to monitor App2 to analyze how long it takes to perform different transactions within the application. The solution must not require changes to the application code. Application developers will constantly develop new versions of App1 and App2. The development process must meet the following requirements: A staging instance of a new application version must be deployed to the application host before the new version is used in production. After testing the new version, the staging version of the application will replace the production version. The switch to the new application version from staging to production must occur without any downtime of the application. Contoso identifies the following requirements for managing Fabrikam access to resources: Every month, an account manager at Fabrikam must review which Fabrikam users have access permissions to App1. Accounts that no longer need permissions must be removed as guests. The solution must minimize development effort. All secrets used by Azure services must be stored in Azure Key Vault.

User input must be minimized when provisioning new web app instances. Whenever possible, existing on-premises licenses must be used to reduce cost. Users must always authenticate by using their corp.fabrikam.com UPN identity. Any new deployments to Azure must be redundant in case an Azure region fails. Whenever possible, solutions must be deployed to Azure by using the Standard pricing tier of Azure App Service. An email distribution group named IT Support must be notified of any issues relating to the directory synchronization services. In the event that a link fails between Azure and the on-premises network, ensure that the virtual machines hosted in Azure can authenticate to Active Directory. Directory synchronization between Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and corp.fabrikam.com must not be affected by a link failure between Azure and the on- premises network. Fabrikam identifies the following database requirements: Database metrics for the production instance of WebApp1 must be available for analysis so that database administrators can optimize the performance settings. To avoid disrupting customer access, database downtime must be minimized when databases are migrated. Database backups must be retained for a minimum of seven years to meet compliance requirements. Fabrikam identifies the following security requirements: Company information including policies, templates, and data must be inaccessible to anyone outside the company. Users on the on-premises network must be able to authenticate to corp.fabrikam.com if an internet link fails. Administrators must be able authenticate to the Azure portal by using their corp.fabrikam.com credentials. All administrative access to the Azure portal must be secured by using multi-factor authentication (MFA). The testing of WebApp1 updates must not be visible to anyone outside the company. To meet the authentication requirements of Fabrikam, what should you include in the solution?

### Fabrikam, Inc. is an engineering company that has offices throughout Europe. The company has a main office in London and three branch offices in Amsterdam, Berlin, and Rome. The network contains two Active Directory forests named corp.fabrikam.com and rd.fabrikam.com. There are no trust relationships between the forests. Corp.fabrikam.com is a production forest that contains identities used for internal user and computer authentication. Rd.fabrikam.com is used by the research and development (R&D) department only. The R&D department is restricted to using on-premises resources only. Each office contains at least one domain controller from the corp.fabrikam.com domain. The main office contains all the domain controllers for the rd.fabrikam.com forest. All the offices have a high-speed connection to the internet. An existing application named WebApp1 is hosted in the data center of the London office. WebApp1 is used by customers to place and track orders. WebApp1 has a web tier that uses Microsoft Internet information Services (IIS) and a database tier that runs Microsoft SQL Server 2016. The web tier and the database tier are deployed to virtual machines that run on Hyper-V. The IT department currently uses a separate Hyper-V environment to test updates to WebApp1. Fabrikam purchases all Microsoft licenses through a Microsoft Enterprise Agreement that includes Software Assurance. The use of WebApp1 is unpredictable. At peak times, users often report delays. At other times, many resources for WebApp1 are underutilized. Fabrikam plans to move most of its production workloads to Azure during the next few years, including virtual machines that rely on Active Directory for authentication. As one of its first projects, the company plans to establish a hybrid identity model, facilitating an upcoming Microsoft 365 deployment. All R&D operations will remain on-premises. Fabrikam plans to migrate the production and test instances of WebApp1 to Azure. Fabrikam identifies the following technical requirements: Website content must be easily updated from a single point. User input must be minimized when provisioning new web app instances. Whenever possible, existing on-premises licenses must be used to reduce cost. Users must always authenticate by using their corp.fabrikam.com UPN identity. Any new deployments to Azure must be redundant in case an Azure region fails. Whenever possible, solutions must be deployed to Azure by using the Standard pricing tier of Azure App Service. An email distribution group named IT Support must be notified of any issues relating to the directory synchronization services. In the event that a link fails between Azure and the on-premises network, ensure that the virtual machines hosted in Azure can authenticate to Active Directory. Directory synchronization between Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and corp.fabrikam.com must not be affected by a link failure between Azure and the on- premises network. Fabrikam identifies the following database requirements: Database metrics for the production instance of WebApp1 must be available for analysis so that database administrators can optimize the performance settings. To avoid disrupting customer access, database downtime must be minimized when databases are migrated. Database backups must be retained for a minimum of seven years to meet compliance requirements.
